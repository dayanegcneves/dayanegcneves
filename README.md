### 👋 Hi, I'm Dayane Neves

I'm a Front-end Developer and future Full Stack Developer, with 2 years of professional experience.  
During this time, I've contributed to diverse projects, building scalable web applications and focusing on clean, user-friendly interfaces.  

### 🚀 Expertise
I hold a degree in Computer Engineering and I am currently pursuing a postgraduate specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I work as a Junior Systems Analyst, mainly focused on developing applications with Vue.js 3, while also gaining experience in backend development with Node.js. Throughout my journey, I have been committed to continuously improving my skills and exploring new technologies. 

At the moment, I am focusing my studies on React.js and Node.js, aiming to expand my expertise and establish myself as a full stack developer capable of contributing across different stages of the software development lifecycle.
